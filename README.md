A project to learn robot programming using the LEGO EV3 Mindstorms brick and [LeJOS](https://lejos.sourceforge.io/index.php) to do the programming in Java.

The robot could be controlled to perform multiple behaviors based on user input.

One of the behaviors was to explore the area and report back to it's coordinates which would be drawn on screen using the companion application. During exploration it would report position and any obstacles encountered.
